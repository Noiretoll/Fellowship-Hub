; ===== MEIKO V2 ROTATION CONFIGURATION =====
; This file configures the rotation framework for Meiko character
; Use AutoHotkey Window Spy to calibrate pixel coordinates and colors

[Game]
; The game executable process name
Process=fellowship-Win64-Shipping.exe

[General]
; RotationType: sequence | priority | auto
;   sequence = Hotkey-triggered combo sequences (like current Meiko)
;   priority = Condition-based priority rotation (like Tiraq swing timer)
;   auto = Auto-execute only (just finisher, no other abilities)
RotationType=sequence

; GCDDelay: Milliseconds to wait between abilities in a sequence (Global Cooldown)
; Adjust this to match your in-game GCD. Default: 1050ms
GCDDelay=1050

; PollInterval: How often (in ms) to check pixel conditions
; Lower = more responsive, higher = less CPU usage. Default: 50ms
PollInterval=50

; ChatToggleKey: Key that opens/closes in-game chat
; Script pauses all inputs while chat is active. Default: Enter
ChatToggleKey=Enter

; ChatCancelKey: Key that cancels chat input
; Returns to normal operation when pressed. Default: Escape
ChatCancelKey=Escape

[Engine_Sequence]
; ToggleHotkey: Key to enable/disable auto-combo feature
; Auto-combo is OFF by default on script start. Default: Alt+F1
ToggleHotkey=!F1

; ===== PIXEL TARGETS =====
; Define pixel locations and colors to monitor for conditions
; Use Window Spy to find exact coordinates and RGB color values
;
; Format for pixel targets:
;   [Pixel_TargetName]
;   X = screen X coordinate
;   Y = screen Y coordinate
;   ActiveColor = 0xRRGGBB color when condition is "active"
;   Tolerance = how much RGB values can differ (10-30 typical)
;   Invert = true/false (optional - inverts the condition check)

[Pixel_Finisher]
; Finisher icon pixel location (top-left of screen, near buffs)
X=1205
Y=1119

; ActiveColor: Color when finisher is AVAILABLE (bright/lit up)
; We use Invert=true because we detect when it's NOT the inactive color
ActiveColor=0xFFFFFF

; Tolerance: How much color can vary (lighting effects, etc)
Tolerance=10

; Invert: Check for NOT matching the color (finisher available = NOT dark)
Invert=true

; ===== ABILITIES =====
; Define abilities and their execution conditions
;
; Common fields:
;   Name = Ability display name
;   Hotkey = In-game keybind to press
;   Type = auto_execute | sequence | priority | normal
;   PixelTarget = Name of pixel target to check (optional)
;   Priority = Execution priority for priority-based rotations (higher = execute first)
;   Cooldown = Milliseconds to wait before using again (optional)
;   Sequence = Comma-separated keys to press (for sequence type)
;   ToggleHotkey = Key to enable/disable this ability (optional, for auto_execute)

[Ability_Finisher]
Name=Finisher
; In-game keybind for finisher ability (backtick key)
Hotkey=``

; Type: auto_execute = Always monitor and execute when pixel condition met
Type=auto_execute

; PixelTarget: Check the "Finisher" pixel target defined above
PixelTarget=Finisher

; Enabled: Start with auto-finisher enabled (true) or disabled (false)
; Default: true (ON at script start)
Enabled=true

; ToggleHotkey: Press F1 to enable/disable auto-finisher
ToggleHotkey=F1

; ===== COMBO SEQUENCES =====
; Define ability sequences triggered by hotkeys
; Format: Sequence=key1, key2, key3
; Each key is pressed with GCDDelay between them

[Ability_Combo3]
Name=Combo3
; Press "3" to trigger this sequence
Hotkey=3
Type=sequence
; Sequence: Press 3, wait GCD, press 1
Sequence=3, 1

[Ability_Combo3Alt]
Name=Combo3Alt
; Press Alt+3 to trigger this alternate sequence
Hotkey=!3
Type=sequence
; Sequence: Press 3, wait GCD, press 2
Sequence=3, 2

[Ability_Combo1]
Name=Combo1
Hotkey=1
Type=sequence
Sequence=1, 2

[Ability_Combo1Alt]
Name=Combo1Alt
Hotkey=!1
Type=sequence
Sequence=1, 3

[Ability_Combo2]
Name=Combo2
Hotkey=2
Type=sequence
Sequence=2, 1

[Ability_Combo2Alt]
Name=Combo2Alt
Hotkey=!2
Type=sequence
Sequence=2, 3

; ===== CONTROLS SUMMARY =====
; F1       = Toggle auto-finisher ON/OFF (default: ON)
; Alt+F1   = Toggle auto-combo ON/OFF (default: OFF)
; F10      = Exit script
; Enter, / = Opens chat (script pauses)
; Escape   = Cancels chat (script resumes)
