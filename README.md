# Fellowship Notes
Everything here is dependant on your UI setup. These will NOT be usable without modification. Review the configuration instructions in the file. Use AutoHotKey Window Spy to identify the required UI configurations information (download AHK 2.0+, search your PC for "Window Spy")  
For research purposes only. Although AHK is rarely punished for uses like this, do not use in-game. It's against TOS, very likely detectable,  and we don't know the devs tolerance for it.
## Configurations
